  <h1>Gameplay</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Up to 60 players compete in matches with battle royale-style gameplay.[7][8][9] Players, represented as
    jellybean-like <a href="">figures</a>,[10] move around a three-dimensional playing field, with additional moves such as jumping,
    grabbing/climbing, or diving to assist gameplay.[11] The aim is to qualify for subsequent rounds by successfully
    completing each of the randomly selected mini-games with randomly selected variations.[12][13] Certain mini-games
    involve running towards a finish line at the end of the map, surviving, and playing tag with other players, while
    others add elements of teamwork.[7][14] On every mini-game, obstacles appear around the map for added
    complexity.[15][16] Players who are too slow, who fall into pink slime, or who fail certain requirements for a
    mini-game, are eliminated. In the final round, the remaining few players compete in a final match with a randomised
    mini-game designed for a smaller player size.[11] The winner of the match is the last player standing or the first
    to finish.[17]

    Using an in-game currency, "Kudos", players can purchase single cosmetics, nameplates, nametags, patterns,
    faceplates, colors, and emotes for their character to show off in-game.[18][19] Players obtain Kudos by doing daily
    challenges and get crowns by winning a match.[20] Crowns were a premium currency until 21 June 2022, whereas they
    now only count towards Crown Rank. Any Crowns that users didn't spend before the game went free to play were
    converted into Kudos.[21]

    Fall Guys regularly hosts new seasons approximately every 2 to 6 months, hosting a new theme and additional content
    every season.[22][23]

    Season 2 added the ability to choose different shows with a different selection

    Season 4 added the "Crown Shards" currency, earned by playing in Squad Mode, where a team of four other players
    cooperates to earn points to progress to the next round, or by completing daily challenges. Crown Shards will be
    automatically converted for additional Crowns.[24][25]

    Season 5 added limited time events, where players need to do certain challenges to earn exclusive costumes and other
    types of cosmetics. In game events usually last between one and seven days and can sometimes be based on different
    franchises, such as Ratchet & Clank, Aloy from Horizon Zero Dawn, Jungle Book, etc.

    Sweet Thieves was added in Season 6, where one team is invisible (only being visible when moving fast) while the
    other team is not. The invisible team (Thieves) needs to bring sweets to the goals while the other team (Guardians)
    is trying to prevent them by using the grabbing mechanic to capture the Thieves and put them in a jail. A button can
    be pressed every 30 seconds to remove the jail barrier.[26][27]

    Free to play Season 1 added Show Bucks, a premium in game currency that can be used to purchase full costumes,
    premium colors, patterns, faceplates, emotes, and the current paid Season Pass. Players are only able to obtain Show
    Bucks through the Season Pass or by purchasing it via microtransactions.[28]

    The same season added Bean Hill Zone, the first-ever limited time collaboration round with Sega.[29] The round came
    with a limited time event and its own show. In Season 3: Sunken Secrets the round was added to Solo Show.

    New costumes are regularly added, usually for a limited time.[30] Some are of characters from different video games
    and media franchises, such as Half-Life, Portal, Godzilla, Team Fortress 2,[31][32] Sonic the Hedgehog,[33]
    Doom,[30][34] Hotline Miami, Ratchet & Clank, Cuphead, Among Us,[35][36][37] Little Big Planet,[38] Astro's
    Playroom,[39] Assassin's Creed, Hatsune Miku,[40] SpongeBob SquarePants,[41] and so on.

  <h1>Development</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    The conception of what became Fall Guys began when Mediatonic was discussing another project in January 2018.[68]
    Lead designer Joe Walsh said that it reminded him of game shows such as Takeshi's Castle and Total Wipeout. He drew
    from that inspiration to create a pitch document for what would become Fall Guys.[2][69] Originally titled Fools'
    Gauntlet, (also later under development using the name "Stumble Chums"), Walsh's pitch featured 100 players
    competing in a battle royale composed of physical challenges.[70] Creative director Jeff Tanton, while initially
    sceptical that creating another battle royale game would be successful, was quickly convinced of the game's
    potential, and forwarded Walsh's pitch to Mediatonic's founders.[68]

    Tanton and Walsh worked on a pitch deck, and principal concept artist Dan Hoang created images featuring colourful,
    bean-shaped characters racing on an obstacle course in the sky. Tanton explained that Hoang's character designs
    helped shift the focus of the game away from the obstacle course itself, to the characters.[71][72] With the pitch
    deck completed, Tanton pitched the game to 10 different publishers at the 2018 Game Developers Conference. Six
    months after Devolver Digital agreed to publish the game, development began.[68][71]

    Fall Guys began its initial prototyping process with a small team, growing to 30 people during development.[73]
    Initial progress on individual minigames was slow which caused the team to worry that there wouldn't be enough
    content for launch. A turning point came when the team made a group of pillars that "Took the opinions of people out
    of the occasion" and allowed the developers to "kill ideas faster". Such pillars include ensuring a minigame was
    "50-50 chaos and skill" and that a level had to be "different every time".[74] Inspired by game shows, and
    differentiating from first-person shooter battle royale games, Mediatonic focused on gameplay variety. By presenting
    the player with several, randomised rounds of game modes, Mediatonic hoped to recreate the experience of being on a
    game show.[73] To help keep the "spirit of playground games and game shows", Mediatonic created an internal rule
    that game modes needed to be explained in three words.[73] Over time, the game underwent numerous other changes. The
    player count was decreased from 100 to 60, because overpopulated games "stopped being readable or fun".[75] In
    testing, Mediatonic noted that players overestimated the number of players, stating "we didn't need as many players
    as we thought to create the crowds we wanted the gameplay to include."[76]

    It's a Knockout, a game show forcing contestants to dress up in oversized costumes, inspired the idea that the
    characters should "have that element of being completely uniquely, badly designed for the task that we were gonna
    put them through".[69] The ragdoll physics is deliberate, to avoid "hyper athletic Ninja Warrior characters" and
    because "falling over is funny".[69] According to Walsh, striking the right balance between funny ragdoll collisions
    and game performance was critical, because "as soon as you lose the ragdoll-ness of the character, you lose the
    comedy".[73] The character designs were inspired by the look of vinyl toys.[77]

    Mediatonic began working on season 2 before the game's release with level designer Joseph Juson, noting that it was
    more of an "expansion" compared to season 3 where the team tried to bring new ideas.[78]

  <h1>Release</h1>
  <p>
    Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout was announced at E3 in June 2019[15] and was released on 4 August 2020 for Microsoft
    Windows and PlayStation 4.[79][80] Several updates ensued for the first season[81][82][83][84] and on 8 October
    2020, the medieval-themed second season was released.[85] The success prompted more hiring.[47][86]

    The Chinese company Bilibili announced in August 2020 that it would be developing a mobile version for Android and
    iOS that would be exclusive to China.[87][88]

    In February 2021, Fall Guys was announced for Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X, scheduled for mid
    2021.[89][90] However, in April 2021, these versions of the game were delayed to 2022, citing greater focus on
    cross-compatibility among all versions of the game.[91]

    In March 2021, Mediatonic and its parent company, Tonic Games Group, were bought by Epic Games.[92] Epic Games later
    announced that they will focus on adding cross-platform compatibility for all versions of Fall Guys,[93][94]
    utilising resources from games such as Fortnite that became available after acquisition by Epic Games.[94]

    On 18 November 2021, Mediatonic announced that Epic Games Accounts will be required in season 6 allowing
    cross-platform progression between PS4 and Steam and the ability to have custom names for Steam players.[56] On 22
    February 2022, Mediatonic released an update adding Lobbies and Friends lists. This uses the Epic Overlay system
    that games like Fortnite or Rocket League have to invite anyone on any platform via Epic Games Accounts.[57]

    On 15 March 2022, Mediatonic announced that starting 5 April 2022 there would be a new launcher that all PlayStation
    players would need to download to keep playing the game on PlayStation.[95] On 9 May 2022, the old PlayStation
    launcher shut down and became unusable.[96] Both launchers were the same besides the new one being published by Epic
    Games instead of Devolver Digital. People who downloaded the new launcher would be able to redeem a free DLC Pink
    Shark costume that was able to be redeemed until the end of season 6.[97]

    Mediatonic and Epic Games transitioned Fall Guys to a free-to-play system alongside its 21 June release on Xbox One,
    Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.[98] Additionally, a dedicated PlayStation 5 version also released, featuring
    enhanced visuals and DualSense effects.[21] The game was also rebranded as simply Fall Guys, without the Ultimate
    Knockout subtitle.[99] To support the free-to-play model, the game included a new season pass system with both a
    free and premium tier of rewards, the latter available to those that purchase the premium pass with real-world
    funds.[100] For Windows, the game was removed from the Steam storefront and made available on Epic Games Store,
    though the Steam version will continue to be updated in sync with the Epic Games Store version. The free-to-play
    versions of Fall Guys also added support for cross-platform play with other platforms.[5] Legacy players who had
    purchased Fall Guys before this transition were given a "Legacy Pack" that includes cosmetics, costumes, and the
    Season 1: Free for All premium season pass for free.[61]

    In July 2022, a bug was discovered that unintentionally bought items from the in-game store instead of previewing
    them. Initially deemed by Mediatonic as "not an issue", they later acknowledged it as a bug after complaints
    mounted.[101] On 1 November 2022 a update was issued to include a hold-to-purchase mechanic for all in-game
    purchases similar to the mechanic in Fortnite.[102]

    On November 2022, Mediatonic announced on twitter of a new feature called Vaulting where some rounds will be
    temporarily removed to increase stability across all platforms.

  <h2>Sales</h2>
  <p>
    Within 24 hours of release, the game had an active player base of more than 1.5 million players.[127] On 10 August
    2020, Devolver Digital announced 2 million copies sold on Steam.[128] During the first day of release, the servers
    for Fall Guys were unexpectedly overloaded due to popularity.[7][18]

    The game's popularity brought several brand collaborations for custom content.[129] Shortly after release Mediatonic
    announced a fundraiser by which the brand that donated the most money to the charity SpecialEffect would have their
    custom skin featured in the game.[130]

    By 26 August 2020, more than 7 million copies of Fall Guys had been sold on Steam, and it was the most downloaded
    monthly PS Plus game of all time.[131] By November 2020, the game had reached more than 10 million sales on
    Steam.[132] According to firm Superdata the game's online revenue for PC in its first month was $185 million from
    8.2 million players, making it the biggest launch on that platform since Overwatch by those metrics.[133] Multiple
    outlets described the game's popularity as a "phenomenon".[134][135][136][137] In December 2020, Mediatonic
    confirmed sales of more than 11 million copies on PC.[138]

    In June 2022, within two weeks of going free-to-play and its release on multiple consoles, Fall Guys' player count
    rose to over 50 million.
